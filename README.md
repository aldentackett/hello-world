# hello-world
This is a description of a repository that is just for me with no use to anyone else. Why am I writing this? Because a website told me to.

I'm Alden, a currently-cynical 16 year old human male that doesn't know how to program. I'm probably going to use this for my angsty poetry about how my parents won't let me have a phone or go to Los Angeles. Dear God, this is not a joke. This is a cry for help.
